## MATLAB Installation Instructions

To begin working with the robot simulations and other MATLAB-based tools, you must first install MATLAB on your system.

### Steps for Installation:
1. **Download MATLAB**:
   - Go to [MathWorks Download Page](https://www.mathworks.com/downloads).
   - Choose the appropriate version for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
   
2. **Create a MathWorks Account** (if you don't have one):
   - Sign up at [MathWorks Account](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_external/create-a-mathworks-account.html).
   
3. **Run the MATLAB Installer**:
   - After downloading, run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions.
   
4. **Activate MATLAB**:
   - Once installation is complete, open MATLAB and activate it using your MathWorks account.

5. **Install Additional Toolboxes** (if needed):
   - If your project requires additional MATLAB toolboxes (e.g., Robotics Toolbox, Simulink, etc.), you can install them via the MATLAB Add-On Explorer.

## Inverted Pendulum Balancing in MATLAB

Balancing an inverted pendulum is a classic control problem where we try to keep a pendulum upright by applying control forces at its base. In MATLAB, we simulate this using state-space models and controllers such as PID.

### Steps for Inverted Pendulum Balancing:
1. **Model the Inverted Pendulum**:
   - Represent the inverted pendulum as a dynamic system using its equations of motion:
     - \(\theta''(t) = \frac{g \sin(\theta) + \cos(\theta) (L \theta'^{2} \sin(\theta) - u)}{L (m + M - m \cos^2(\theta))}\)
     - Where:
       - \(\theta\) is the angle of the pendulum,
       - \(g\) is gravity,
       - \(L\) is the length of the pendulum,
       - \(m\) and \(M\) are the masses, and
       - \(u\) is the control input.
     
2. **Implement the State-Space Model**:
   - Define the state-space representation in MATLAB:
     ```matlab
     A = [0 1 0 0;
          0 0 -m*g/M 0;
          0 0 0 1;
          0 0 (m+M)*g/(M*L) 0];
     B = [0; 1/M; 0; -1/(M*L)];
     C = [1 0 0 0];
     D = 0;
     ```

3. **Design a Controller**:
   - Use PID or LQR (Linear Quadratic Regulator) to stabilize the system. For example:
     ```matlab
     K = lqr(A, B, Q, R);
     ```

4. **Simulate the Pendulum**:
   - Run a simulation with initial conditions (pendulum at a certain angle) and control laws to balance it:
     ```matlab
     [t, y] = ode45(@(t, y) inverted_pendulum_dynamics(t, y, A, B, K), time_span, initial_conditions);
     plot(t, y);
     ```

## Inverse and Forward Kinematics

Kinematics deals with the motion of bodies in space. In robotics, we use **forward kinematics** and **inverse kinematics** to determine the position and orientation of robot links.

### Forward Kinematics:
- **Definition**: Forward kinematics involves calculating the position and orientation of the robot's end-effector given the joint angles and lengths of the links.
- **Example**: For a 2-link robot arm, the forward kinematic equations are:
  \[
  x = L_1 \cos(\theta_1) + L_2 \cos(\theta_1 + \theta_2)
  \]
  \[
  y = L_1 \sin(\theta_1) + L_2 \sin(\theta_1 + \theta_2)
  \]

### Inverse Kinematics:
- **Definition**: Inverse kinematics involves determining the required joint angles to achieve a specific position of the end-effector.
- **Example**: Solving for \(\theta_1\) and \(\theta_2\) given \(x\) and \(y\).

## Explanation about Key Blocks in Simulations

### 1. **World Frame Block**:
   - This block represents the global coordinate system, defining the origin and axes that all other components reference.

### 2. **Rigid Transform Block**:
   - The rigid transform block applies transformations (translation and rotation) to a frame of reference. It is used to move objects relative to one another in space.

### 3. **6-DOF Block**:
   - The 6-DOF block is used to describe a rigid bodyâ€™s position and orientation in 3D space. It allows you to simulate the motion of robots or parts in 6 degrees of freedom (3 for position, 3 for orientation).

### 4. **Box to Belt Out and Box to Belt In**:
   - These blocks simulate the movement of boxes onto and off a conveyor belt, typically used in pick-and-place tasks.

### 5. **Gripper Working**:
   - The gripper consists of two plates that move toward an object to pick it up and move it away to release the object. It is controlled by a servo that actuates the plates' opening and closing.

## Pick and Place Simulation

This section simulates the process of picking up an object and placing it at a different location using the robot's gripper.

- The simulation involves:
  - Gripping an object using the two plates of the gripper.
  - Moving the object from one location to another using robotic arms or a conveyor belt.

### Simulation Steps:
1. Initialize the environment and robot with a target object.
2. Activate the gripper to close around the object.
3. Move the robot arm to the desired location.
4. Release the object at the new location.
